## Security Guidelines

### Never Reveal Sensitive Information

### Data Handling
- Mask or redact sensitive information in logs and error messages
- Implement proper data encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Follow data privacy regulations and best practices
- Use secure session management

### Development Guidelines
- Always assume code will be reviewed and potentially exposed
- Use placeholder values in examples and documentation
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Use secure defaults for all configurations

## General Development Rules

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use proper error handling and validation
- Write meaningful comments and documentation
- Follow the existing code style and patterns

### Testing
- Write comprehensive tests for all functionality
- Include security testing in the test suite
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Ensure tests don't expose sensitive data

### Performance
- Optimize for performance without compromising security
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor and profile application performance

Remember: Security is not optional. When in doubt, choose the more secure option.
